							<h2> Together, let's make sure colleges
							<br />
							see how amazing you already are.</h2>
							<p>
							It really is that simple. Every student is unique. Every person has their own goals, strengths, and weaknesses. The best applications are always those that give the best and most fullest picture of an individual candidate. Why? Because then the schools you get into will be the ones that are the best match for you, and the ones you did not get into, you probably wouldn't have been happy and successful there anyways.

						<h3> My Philosophy</h3>
						<p>
						When you ask a college admissions officer what they look for and what the ~ secret formula ~ is to get into their top-tier program, you always get the same answer. </p> 
						<blockquote>"Just be yourself. There is no formula" <br /> -- Every College Admissions Officer Ever</blockquote>
						<p>
						Now if you were anything like me growing up, you probably shrugged off this piece of advice as a cop-out answer. What do they mean "Just be yourself"? If there is NO formula, then why does it seem like every person who gets into XYZ college was involved with [insert a long list of clubs here], played [insert several instruments here], and held leadership positions in [insert some combination of student council, robotics, science olympiad, MUN, etc.]??<br><br> Well, my dear reader, not everything is as it seems on the surface.  
						<br>
						<br>
						It just so happens (to no one's surprise), the college admissions officers are actually completely correct and honest in their advice. While it does seem like an overwhelming number of people who get into great colleges fit a similar profile, an even greater number of people who fit a similar profile DO NOT get into such colleges.  
						<br>
						<br>
						So no. You are not guaranteed admission to [insert excellent college here] if you fit a particular profile. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>If, however, you put forth the best and fullest representation of yourself in your application, you ARE guaranteeing that every college admitting you will be an excellent fit for you and your endeavors. And you WILL be successful at that school.</b>

						So while I cannot promise you that working with me will land you in an Ivy+ school, <b> I CAN promise that I will work my hardest to ensure that the application you submit represents your authentic self in the best way possible. </b>

									<h3>About Me</h3>
									<div class="row justify-content-center">
										<div class="col-8 col-12-narrower">
											Hello! My name is Dheekshu. I graduated from MIT with both my bachelors degree (double major in Mechanical Eng. and Electrical Eng & CS) and my masters degree (MEng in EECS with a concentration in Machine Learning). I have more than 10 years of experience mentoring and tutoring students in everything from writing to mathematics to machine learning. When I'm not teaching or mentoring, I enjoy reading, travelling, singing, playing the piano, doing theater (in non-pandemic times of course), and cooking. I am currently living in Norfolk County, Massachusetts with my family. 
											<br>
											<br>
											So why college coaching? I decided to start college app coaching after having recieved several requests from friends/family friends. Since finishing the college application process, I have reviewed over 50 college application essays to schools like Princeton, University of Michigan, MIT, University of California, WPI, and more. 
											<br>
											<br>
											I really enjoyed my college application process. I greatly improved as a communicator. It was also an excellent exercise in self-reflection and writing, and even now, I look back on my essays as a way to remind myself of my goals. Now, I hope to provide my students with a similarly enjoyable and enlightening experience at an affordable price.

						<h2>My Services</h2>
						<div class="features-row">
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-graduation-cap accent2"></span>
								<h3>Common Application</h3>
								<p>The Common Application has two major components that you should use to showcase your wonderful character and abilities: the essay and extracurricular section. These components to the application must be specific to you, but need not be specific to the school.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-comments accent3"></span>
								<h3>Interview Prep</h3>
								<p>Interviewing is a skill. Like any other skill, you can improve with practice, more practice, and even more practice. </p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<div class="features-row">
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-pencil-alt accent4"></span>
								<h3>Supplemental Essay Review</h3>
								<p>The supplemental essays are a further chance to show schools what you're made of and who you are but more importantly, it's a chance for you to talk about why you are interested in a specific school and why that specific school should offer you a place in their class! </p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-football-ball accent5"></span>
								<h3>Extra Curricular Planning</h3>
								<p> Sometimes we need some help from others to learn how to make the most of our high school experience. I will never tell you what activities to do to get into XYZ school. That's not how this works. We should always be learning, pushing ourselves, and preparing ourselves for the next step. It just so happens certain activities can help you explore and prepare for certain paths, and of course, colleges want to get to know you, so they care about the paths you have explored.</p>

							<section class="box special">
								<h3>Hourly Rate ($40-$90/hour)</h3>
								<p>I offer hourly rates depending on the service provided and where the student is in the process. My prices are less than half of what private college counseling typically costs because I want this service to be affordable. I would recommend considering hourly rates if you are unsure how much help will be required and want to see if my style of coaching is helpful and useful to you. I would also recommend hourly pricing for freshmen and sophomores (9th and 10th graders) looking for help on extracurricular planning. Please contact me for further details! We can also discuss hourly prices during the 30 minute free initial consultation. </p>
							</section>

						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-narrower">

							<section class="box special">
								<h3>Package Rates</h3>
								<p>I offer packages as well, which end up being significantly cheaper than the hourly rate (if looking at $/hour figure). They include help on a fixed number of essays (up to an hour limit) and a fixed number of additional hours of help. This help can take the form of offline email communications, online video calls, off-line document editing, and more. Packages are best for juniors (in the spring of their junior year) and seniors (in the fall of their senior year). </p>
